    <h5 class="causeshome"><b><i> Causes for Unionization:</i></b> Due to issues such as inconsistent and low paying jobs, working long hours with no minimum rest period, and lack of reimbursement for travel time, cost, or wardrobe expenses, actors found it important to create a voice for themselves and unionize.</h5>
    <h6 class="uniontoday"><i><b> SAG-AFTRA Today:</i></b> The union prioritizes these same issues relating to pay and working conditions, however, it faces problems due to a lack of diversity and representation for all performers. Our site strives to provide a wide variety of perspectives and experiences and ensure that more people are given the opportunity to share their voice and experience. </h6>

    <h5 class="thenandnow"><b><i> SAG-AFTRA Then and Now:</i></b> Pictured above are SAG members celebrating the awards in 1957, and members celebrating in 2023. While much progress has been made in terms of diversity and inclusion within the union- which you can see represented here, there is still a long way to go, which our interviews with actors help attest to.</h5>

    <h5 class="techchanges"><i><b> Changes in the Union:</i></b> These two photos help to illustrate how technology has evolved, and how the union has evolved alongside it. With newer cameras, equipment, etc., more things are possible now than in previous years. While large-scale Hollywood sets such as the photo on the left still exist, sets like the one on the right; with a few cameras and lenses doing the work of what had to be done by many in the past, are becoming more popular. </h5>
